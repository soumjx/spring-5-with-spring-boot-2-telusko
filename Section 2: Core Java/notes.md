# Setting Up Java Development Environment (4/500)

## Editors vs IDEs
- Need a place to write Java code: editor or IDE.
- Editors: Notepad, WordPad, Notepad++, Edit+.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) includes code writing, running, compiling, debugging.
- Beginners may start with editors; for real projects, an IDE is better.
- Popular Java IDEs: VS Code (used in course), Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans.
- Personal favorite: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (paid), Community version has limited features.
- VS Code chosen for being lightweight yet powerful.

## Java Compiler & JDK
- Need to compile Java code using JDK (Java Development Kit).
- Two JDK versions: Oracle’s proprietary and open-source variants (Corretto, others).
- Oracle JDK is free again and used in course.
- Java versions update every 6 months; basic language stays backward compatible.
- Choose Long-Term Support (LTS) version Java 17 over Java 19 for stability.

## Downloading & Installing
- Download JDK and VS Code via browser.
- Select OS-specific version: Windows, Mac (Intel or Apple chip), Linux.
- Installation is straightforward: mostly "Next" clicks.
- Windows users must set PATH environment variable pointing to JDK's bin folder.
- Verify installation by running `java --version` and `javac --version` in Command Prompt.

## VS Code Setup
- Popular IDE, familiar to many programmers.
- After install, launch VS Code.
- Install extensions as needed (first 4 default for beginners).
- Open terminal in VS Code and verify JDK by running `javac`.
